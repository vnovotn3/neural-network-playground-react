# Neural Network Playground

This is a showcase web app using React and TypeScript. If you're looking for a front-end web or mobile developer (React & React Native) send me a message on LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/vojtech-novotny-83134277

-----

This React app provides a playground for building your own neural network for classification 2D points in the plane. 

The training of the network is implemented using Tensorflow JS library: https://www.tensorflow.org/js

Key features are:
* editing number of hidden layers (up to 5)
* editing number of neurons in each layer (up to 5)
* setting learning rate, activation function applied in hidden layers and regularization
* drawing input points in canvas or choosing a preset
* uploading input points from a .txt file
* step by step or continuous simulation of the training process (up to 9999 epochs)

The app is running here: https://vnovotn3.github.io/neural-network-playground-react/
